# sadmin

`sadmin` is a light-weight admin page. It's really simple. Just drag `sadmin` on to your website, then go to `/sadmin/`. And, the default password is `password`.

## Changing the password

In `sadmin/password.php`, after `?>`, put in your password. No newlines, no space before, just the password.

## Uploading a website

Upload your website as a ZIP file in the admin page. Make sure that your files are in the root, not in a folder.

And make sure that you don't have a folder called `sadmin`, that will break `sadmin`.
